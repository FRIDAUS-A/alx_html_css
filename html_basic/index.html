            <h1 style="color: blue;">With that said, here are 5 Proven Tips to Help You 
                Transition Into Tech: </h1>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>What transferable skills do you have?</b></li>
                    <p>A sizeable number of people that transition to tech do so by leveraging their previously acquired skills—though these skills are mostly no-code or non-technical. For instance, a Customer Service Representative at a local bank could
                         easily transition to a similar 
                         role at a FinTech startup. A journalist or creative writer could try out technical writing and pick up really fast. Human Resource Managers/Recruiters in conventional companies would easily settle in as technical recruiters after a few months of training. The list goes on. 

                        What you should do is identify the skills you 
                        already possess and see what roles those could get you in tech. If you have your eyes set on an entirely different role (one that doesn’t align with your current skills), check out the skills required for that role and how to go about acquiring them. Then go for it. </p>
                        <li><b>Search for opportunities in industries where you have 
                            prior experience</b></li>
                            <p>This is in many ways similar to what we discussed above—about seeking opportunities in tech where your previously acquired skills are a match. Say you’re a Risk & Compliance Officer at a local bank; you can work the same job at a FinTech startup. A seasoned chartered accountant can head the Accounts & Finance unit at a tech startup. Medical doctors could, for instance, work as consultants at HealthTech startups offering home services. Product Managers can easily function across numerous industries. Conventional journalists and content creators could niche down and focus on reporting/producing content on tech and so on. </p>
